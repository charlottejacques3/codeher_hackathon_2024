# Pennywise
## Description

**Technologies used:** HTML/CSS/JS, Django

I participated in the CODEHER+ Hackathon hosted by the University of Victoria Women in Engineering and Computer Science in October 2024. The prompt was to create a financial management platform for students.

To achieve this, I collaborated with group members to create a web application allowing the user to set a budget and track expenses, and notifying them if they are over budget in a certain category. To make the website more engaging and interactive, we also implemented a Wordle-like minigame reminding the user not to overspend.

My role in this project was primarily on the backend, where I implemented a database and models using Python's Django framework.
